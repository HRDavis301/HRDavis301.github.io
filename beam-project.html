            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This project focused on the design and fabrication of a hybrid cantilever beam using a
                <strong>PLA–balsa composite</strong>. The goal was to achieve a lightweight structure that could support a
                <strong>5&nbsp;lb load</strong> with less than <strong>0.25&nbsp;in deflection</strong>. By leveraging finite
                element analysis (FEA) and structural optimization, we sought to maximize the beam’s
                strength‑to‑weight ratio while meeting strict deflection constraints. Materials were chosen for their
                complementary properties: PLA provides rigidity and ease of 3D printing, while balsa wood offers
                excellent strength‑to‑weight characteristics.

            <h2>Design Process</h2>
            <p>
                The design began with a conventional rectangular beam model to establish baseline performance.
                FEA simulations were then conducted to evaluate stress distribution and deflection under loading.
                Based on these results, we introduced a <strong>sinusoidal truss‑lattice geometry</strong> into the beam
                interior. Lattice structures are known for their ability to <em>reduce mass while enhancing mechanical
                properties</em>【412534442248131†L187-L206】. The varying cross‑section of the lattice beam results in a
                non‑prismatic structure with a tailored moment of inertia, which improves flexural stiffness and
                load transfer【412534442248131†L199-L206】.
            </p>
            <p>
                Iterative FEA and parameter sweeps were used to refine the lattice amplitude and frequency to
                maximize stiffness while minimizing mass. The final design featured a repeating sinusoidal pattern
                that increased the beam’s <strong>strength‑to‑weight ratio to 21.7</strong>, outperforming the baseline beam and
                earning top marks in the class. The beam was subsequently fabricated using fused deposition
                modeling for the PLA components and precision‑cut balsa wood inserts. A custom test rig was used
                to apply the 5&nbsp;lb load and verify deflection and structural integrity.

            <h2>Lattice Structures and Additive Manufacturing</h2>
            <p>
                Lattice structures are increasingly applied in engineering systems because they <em>reduce mass
                and enhance mechanical properties</em>【412534442248131†L187-L206】. In the context of cantilever beams,
                lattice geometries allow for the design of lightweight, non‑prismatic beams that can be
                manufactured using additive manufacturing. Studies have shown that surface‑based lattice designs
                such as Schwarz‑D perform better than beam‑based lattice structures due to their
                <em>stretch‑dominated topology</em>, which improves flexural stiffness and modulus【412534442248131†L203-L207】.
                Finite element analysis (FEA) validation indicates that the distribution of stresses in lattice
                beams matches experimental results closely, providing confidence in simulation‑driven design
                processes【412534442248131†L207-L213】.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this project, the sinusoidal lattice pattern took inspiration from such research by utilizing a
                periodic unit cell to create a beam that behaves like a truss. The design illustrates how
                additive manufacturing enables the fabrication of complex, optimized geometries that are
                impractical with traditional manufacturing methods.
